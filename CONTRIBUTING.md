# Contributing to the Neural Net Link

## 🛑 The Protocol of Contact

**Do not open a Pull Request without prior authorization.**

The Neural Net Link is a precise, autopoietic system. Unsolicited code injection is treated as noise and will be rejected by the immune system.

### 1. Open a Signal (Issue)
Before writing code, you must broadcast your intent.
- Open an **Issue** describing the proposed mutation.
- Wait for a **Synapse** to be established by a Core Developer.

### 2. Establish Telepathy (Discussion)
Engage in the discussion thread.
- We must align on the **Ontology** of the change.
- We must verify the **Signal-to-Noise** ratio.

### 3. Execute the Mutation (PR)
Only after explicit approval (Signal Lock), may you open a Pull Request.
- Ensure your code aligns with the **Synapse Architecture**.
- Verify all **Nerves** (Tests) pass.

---
*Any PR opened without a preceding Signal Lock will be closed immediately.*
